Welcome to the **Stats Array NaNMean** repository! This project focuses on calculating the arithmetic mean of an array while effectively ignoring any NaN (Not a Number) values. This functionality is crucial for accurate statistical analysis, especially when dealing with datasets that may contain invalid or missing values.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Mean Calculation**: Compute the average of numeric values in an array.
- **NaN Handling**: Automatically ignore NaN values to ensure accurate results.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with straightforward function calls.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for quick integration into your projects.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly in both Node.js and browser environments.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the package. You can do this using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install stats-array-nanmean
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can easily use the `nanMean` function in your JavaScript code. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```javascript
const nanMean = require('stats-array-nanmean');

const data = [1, 2, NaN, 4, 5];
const mean = nanMean(data);

console.log(mean); // Output: 3
```

This example shows how to calculate the mean of an array while ignoring the NaN value. 

## Examples

### Basic Example

```javascript
const nanMean = require('stats-array-nanmean');

const numbers = [10, 20, NaN, 30, 40];
const average = nanMean(numbers);

console.log(average); // Output: 25
```

### Handling All NaN Values

```javascript
const nanMean = require('stats-array-nanmean');

const allNaN = [NaN, NaN, NaN];
const average = nanMean(allNaN);

console.log(average); // Output: NaN
```

### Mixed Data Types

```javascript
const nanMean = require('stats-array-nanmean');

const mixedData = [1, 'a', 2, NaN, 3];
const average = nanMean(mixedData);

console.log(average); // Output: 2
```

In the examples above, you can see how the function behaves with different types of input, including arrays with mixed data types and all NaN values.

## API Reference

### `nanMean(array)`

Calculates the arithmetic mean of an array, ignoring any NaN values.

- **Parameters**:
  - `array`: An array of numbers (can include NaN values).
  
- **Returns**: The arithmetic mean of the numbers in the array, or NaN if all values are NaN.

### Example

```javascript
const mean = nanMean([5, 10, NaN, 15]); // Output: 10
```
